# Description of Runner

> Don't you have those lazy days when you don't want to move? However, you are really hungry and really want food from like collegetown, but you live on north campus... If this is not the case, is it the case that you want some money? Sometimes, finding a job on campus can be tough, especially one with very little commitment. Well, if you can relate to any of these, then this is the app for you! With Runner, you can post a job to get Collegetown Bagel or Utea. Anyone with the app can accept the job and get the food for you! This is a win win app for both the job poster at home or even in the library and for the runner who needs some quick cash. Not only does this app support food delivery, but it also branches out all other kinds of small jobs. For example, you can post a job to take some pictures of a textbook for a few bucks. Of course, this app currently relies on the integrity of both parties. Sign up for an account today!
